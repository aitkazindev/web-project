          $24 Billion and Global Giants: Why Businesses Are Hooked on Influencer
          Marketing
        </h1>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg" data-i18n="news3_intro">
          Influencer marketing has transformed from a "nice-to-have" into an
          essential strategy for businesses worldwide. The data proves it:
          according to Oberlo, the global influencer marketing market grew from
          $1.7 billion in 2016 to a staggering
          <strong>$24 billion in 2024</strong>—a 14x increase in just 8 years.

          Why This Rapid Growth?

            <strong>Top Global Brands Lead the Way:</strong> According to
            Business Insider, leaders like Nike, Dior, and Samsung are investing
            heavily in influencer campaigns, making them a core part of their
            strategy. These companies use influencers to promote their products
            more authentically and connect with customers through trust.

            <strong>High Return on Investment (ROI):</strong> Influencer
            marketing consistently delivers outstanding results. Dash Hudson
            reports that every $1 spent on an Instagram influencer campaign
            returns an average of $4.12—proving how effective this channel can
            be when executed correctly.
          </li>
          <li data-i18n="news3_growth_3">
            <strong>Trust is the Secret Ingredient:</strong> Consumers crave
            real, honest content. A study by Sprout Social found that 67% of
            people trust influencers who are authentic and opinionated more than
            any other type of brand communication. That trust leads to
            conversions.
